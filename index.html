        <p>I studied Banking and Finance at the University of Nigeria Nsukka and graduated with a second class upper division (4.20 cgpa) in 2018. In 2019, I registered for the Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria Examinations to become an Associate
            Member and in 2021, i concluded the exams and achieved my goal of becoming a Chartered Banker. I am a Banker with a difference. I love to read and learn new skills. My journey towards web development started in 2021 when i enrolled for a 5
            day coding challenge with Code Institute. It brought out the zeal to learn more. I subsequently enrolled for classes on Web Development with Afro Fem Coders. It is a community of women across Africa interested in coding. With the community,
            I learnt HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

           Kindly click the link to play my game. <a href="https://sandraobodo.github.io" style="color:white">The Great Guessing Game</a> There is the Easy and Hard mode. You get to guess the possible color mixture looking at the RGB combination. 
           If your guess is wrong, the square disappears but if it is right, all of the squares lights up. Enjoy!
